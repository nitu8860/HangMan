# HangMan

This is a simple implementation of the Hangman game using Java.

## Getting Started

To run the game, you will need to have Java installed on your system. You can run the game by executing the following command in your terminal:

java Main.java

## How to Play:

-The computer selects a random word from a list of words.

-The player has to guess letters that make up the word.

-For each incorrect guess, a part of the hangman is drawn.

-The player wins if they correctly guess all the letters of the word before the hangman is completely drawn.

## Project Structure:

The project consists of the following files:

Main.java: The main Java file that contains the implementation of the game.
